# Disable specific checks that don't apply to our use case

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# We intentionally use unquoted variables in some cases for word splitting
disable=SC2086

# SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?
# We use $? for clarity in some contexts
disable=SC2181

# SC2250: Prefer braces around variable references
# Cosmetic style preference - not required for correctness
disable=SC2250

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Some variables are used in sourced scripts
disable=SC2034

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# We don't need to follow all sourced files for analysis
disable=SC1091

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# This is intentional for awk scripts where we use -v for variables
disable=SC2016

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# We dynamically source files based on runtime paths
disable=SC1090

# SC2295: Expansions inside ${..} need to be quoted separately
# Pattern matching in parameter expansion is intentional
disable=SC2295

# SC2329: Function is never invoked
# Some internal functions are invoked indirectly or used as callbacks
disable=SC2329

# SC2317: Command appears to be unreachable
# Trap handlers and callback functions are invoked indirectly
disable=SC2317

# SC1078: Did you forget to close this quoted string
# False positives for HTML embedded in bash strings
disable=SC1078

# SC1079: This is actually an end quote
# False positives for HTML class attributes with single quotes
disable=SC1079

# SC2140: Word is of the form "A"B"C"
# HTML attributes inside bash strings
disable=SC2140

# Set shell dialect
shell=bash
