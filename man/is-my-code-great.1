NAME
    is-my-code-great - Test code verification tool

SYNOPSIS
    is-my-code-great [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
    is-my-code-great tool to verify arbitrary aspects about test code.

    By default, it analyzes Flutter/Dart projects, but is designed to be extensible to other frameworks (such as C#) in the future. The tool can auto-detect the framework based on files in the directory, or you can specify it explicitly.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Show this help message and exit.

    -f, --framework FRAMEWORK
        Specify the framework to analyze (e.g., dart, csharp). If not provided, the tool will attempt to auto-detect based on project files.

    -v, --verbose
        Enable verbose output.

    DIRECTORY
        The path to the project directory to analyze. Defaults to the current directory if not specified.

VALIDATIONS
    big-test-files
        Detects test functions or methods that are longer than 15 lines.

    single-test-per-file
        Counts files that contain exactly one test function or method.

    expect-on-keys
        Counts the number of expect statements that use a key-based finder (e.g., find.byKey).

    pump-and-settle-without-duration
        Counts occurrences of tester.pumpAndSettle() without a duration argument.

    pump-without-duration
        Counts occurrences of tester.pump() without a duration argument.

    verifies
        Counts the number of verify and verifyNever calls.

    widgets-predicate
        Counts the number of times find.byWidgetPredicate is used in tests.

EXAMPLES
    Analyze the current directory (auto-detect framework):
        is-my-code-great

    Analyze a Dart project in a specific directory:
        is-my-code-great -f dart /path/to/project

    Analyze a C# project (future support):
        is-my-code-great -f csharp /path/to/project
